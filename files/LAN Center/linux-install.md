## Installing OpenArena
Installing OpenArena is as simple as copying over the file designed for your architecture. If you're not sure what architecture you're running, follow the steps abve to figure it out. 32-bit architectures are going to copy over and run `openarena.i386`, whereas 64-bit architectures are going to copy over and run `openarena.x86_64`.


## Installing Xonotic
Installing Xonotic is relatively straight-forward. You copy over one of the two `.sh` files in the `Xonotic` directory on the file server, and run it by typing in `./xonotic-linux-*.sh`. If the one you copied over didn't perform well or simply didn't start up Xonotic, copy over the other file and run it the same way.


## Installing Hedgewars
Installing Hedgewars requires an active internet connection. Full instructions are [here](https://hedgewars.org/download.html#gnu_linux).

## Installing 0AD
Installing 0AD is as simple as copying over the `0AD.AppImage` file, make it executable by running `chmod +x 0AD.AppImage`, and run it by running `./0AD.AppImage`.

## Installing Spiral Knights
Installing Spiral Knights is similar to installing 0AD. You copy over `Spiral Knights.bin`, make it executable by running `chmod +x Spiral\ Knights.bin`, and run it by running `./Spiral\ Knights.bin`

## Installing OpenRA
