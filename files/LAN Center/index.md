The LAN Center is the area where you can bring your personal computer (laptop or desktop), hook up to one of the network switches, and play a game of ET: Legacy, TF2, GMod, Quake III, Unreal Tournament, and Minecraft. 


## How to connect

If you don't have an Ethernet cable at your seat, but you do have a computer with a Wi-Fi connection you can connect to the access point

## How to install

All of these games, with the exception of Minecraft which **MUST** be started with an active internet connection first, are hosted on the local [file server](ftp://10.10.10.x/)!
