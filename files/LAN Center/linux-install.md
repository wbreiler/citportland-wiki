## Installing ET: Legacy
Installing ET: Legacy is as simple as copying over the shell script designed for your architecture. If you aren't sure what architecture you're running, run `uname -m`. If you're running 32-bit (`i686` or `i386`), copy over the shell script called `ET Legacy 32-bit.sh` and run it by typing in `./ET\ Legacy\ 32-bit.sh`. If you're running 64-bit (`x86_64`), copy over the shell script called `ET Legacy 64-bit.sh` and run it by typing in `./ET\ Legacy\ 64-bit.sh`. Accept the Terms and Conditions, and follow the instructions.


## Installing OpenArena
Installing OpenArena is as simple as copying over the file designed for your architecture. If you're not sure what architecture you're running, follow the steps abve to figure it out. 32-bit architectures are going to copy over and run `openarena.i386`, whereas 64-bit architectures are going to copy over and run `openarena.x86_64`.


## Installing Xonotic
Installing Xonotic is relatively straight-forward. You copy over one of the two `.sh` files in the `Xonotic` directory on the file server, and run it by typing in `./xonotic-linux-*.sh`. If the one you copied over didn't perform well or simply didn't start up Xonotic, copy over the other file and run it the same way.
