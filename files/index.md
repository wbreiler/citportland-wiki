PineDocs is a simple, fast, customizable and lightweight site for browsing files.


## Setup
Edit the `config/config.yaml` file to fit your needs.

If you already have a content directory you want to use, change the `content_dir` to point to that directory. If not, just delete this file and start adding your own content.


## Tips
- Press `F` on your keyboard to focus on the search bar.
- Press `*` on your keyboard to open all directories recursively.
- You can easily create your own color-scheme, just copy-paste an existing color-scheme in `public/color-schemes`, and then edit `config/config.yaml`.
